IncrementalLearning
===================

I am planning on providing some implementations of the Learn++ algorithm in Matlab. Please direct any questions, comments, or suggestions to <gregory.ditzler@gmail.com>. More details to come.



About the functions 
===================
I have added documentation to all the files. Please use `help(myFun)` (where `myFun` is the function you are interested in) in the Matlab commandline for a detailed description on how to use the function. Also refer to the unit tests for examples.
