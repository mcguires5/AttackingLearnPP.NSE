Going to run the following sets through 100 interations to average out the results. 

X2CDT
X2CDT_FastMoving
X2CDT_FasterMoving
X2CDT_FastMovingx8
GEARS_2C_2D

For those, I will run them 100 times and store a plot of the KL divergence to test how well SINDy does. 

I may run just KL Divergence tests on the rest of the datasets to see how SINDy does tracking those. 

All against class 2 with the following settings

Kernel = "Linear";
lambda = 8e-3;
polyOrder = 1;
useSine = 0;
sineMultiplier = 10;
useExp = 0;
expMultiplier = 10;
maxSteps = 150; %250
stepSize = 10; %5
degree = 3;
coef0 = 1;
c = 2; % Class to attack
numAtkPts = 40;
timeStepsInPastToAttack = 4;
